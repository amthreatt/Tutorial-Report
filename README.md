# Tutorial-Report
For my tutorial report I chose to follow [Mozilla's Geting started with the web tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) and in this tutorial I was walked through what goes into an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file which have all been added to this repository, along with a couple of images I included in my website. These files were made in Visual Studio Code. 

## HTML
The HTML file I created served as a basic intro to web developement. So what you will see in it is an image at the top that I had imported to a folder named images, hence the path name. Then I spent I included some headers and subheaders to get an idea of how those are represented in the website.

## CSS
I created four rulesets, one for html, img, body, and h1 which represented by first header. The ruleset for html delcares a font size of ten pixels, in the font PT Sans which is a sans serif font I got from the google font library, and lastly the text color which is a teal. The ruleset for img set the width of all my images at 300 pixels and the height remain auto so that the image would not appear warped. The body ruleset set the width, margin, background color, padding, and created a boarder around the text. Lastly h1 set its margin and its own dapping, and I used the same font color as the html file.

## JavaScript
The Javascript file demonstrates two funcitons, one is when you click on an image it will change to a different image, and the second is a query button that allows user input of a string of addition that can be added together if inputted correctly.
